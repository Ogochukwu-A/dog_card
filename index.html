                <p class="life"> Her name is Snyder. She's beautiful, full of energy, and
                    fiercely loyal. She's obedient, intelligent, 
                    and protective.  She's a fast learner and we love learning new languages together . 
                    She's a Velcro dog and we spend lots of time together ðŸ˜Š. She's really lovely .
                    Snyder is my best friend and I hope we get to spend many more years together. 
                    I am super grateful to have her in my life ðŸ¥°. She's sleeping right now, 
                    after having the most delicious chicken brisket sandwich ðŸ˜Š.
